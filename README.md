# üöÄ SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction
Classification model predicting Falcon 9 landing success based on mission data ([IBM Data Science course](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/92W1QUBMSKQQ) capstone)

---

## Project objectives

Explore, visualize and model SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data using a complete data science pipeline. The main goal is to identify the key factors that influence the success rate of first stage landings.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This project was developed in an educational context using partially pre-prepared code from the IBM course. However, I completed, extended, and documented all the analysis, modeling, and interpretation steps independently.

## Key steps

1. Data wrangling
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Implementing and evaluating ML models
4. Summary and conclusions

---

## Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks

---

## What I learned throughout the project

- Structure and workflow of a data science pipeline.
- Data collection and data wrangling methods.
- Using Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
- Using Matplotlib for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- Applying statistical analysis and machine learning to uncover hidden patterns.
- Creating well-documented Github repositories with Jupyter notebooks.

## Next steps/future work
- Expand the dataset to help the models generalize better.
- Incorporate new features to reveal factors that haven't been considered yet.
- Integrate additional data sources like weather conditions.
