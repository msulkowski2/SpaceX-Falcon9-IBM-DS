# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction
Classification model predicting Falcon 9 landing success based on mission data ([IBM Data Science course](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/92W1QUBMSKQQ) capstone)

---

## Project objectives

Explore, visualize and model SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data using a complete data science pipeline. The main goal is to identify the key factors that influence the success rate of first stage landings.

> ⚠️ Note: This project was developed in an educational context using partially pre-prepared code from the IBM course. However, I completed, extended, and documented all the analysis, modeling, and interpretation steps independently.
