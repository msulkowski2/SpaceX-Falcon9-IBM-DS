    "The goal of this project is to **predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully**.\n",

    "Falcon 9 is a **reusable rocket** developed by the company SpaceX. It consists of two main parts (stages):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **First stage** is responsible for the initial launch and pushing the rocket upwards into the sky\n",
    "- Second stage activates after the first stage separates and is in charge of placing the payload into orbit\n",
    "\n",
    "The key part is that the **first stage must land back on Earth** so it can be reused. \n",
    "SpaceX advertises a single Falcon 9 rocket launch at a cost of $62M, while other providers can charge upwards of $165M. A big part of the cost savings comes from being able to reuse the first stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we can figure out what factors influence a successful landing, we can build a model to predict it â€” which helps with planning, saving money, and improving future missions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the IBM course, I completed labs on collecting data from the [SpaceX API](\"https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/past\") and a [Wikipedia article](\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_and_Falcon_Heavy_launches\") on Falcon 9 launches. This notebook skips that part and uses the prepared `space-data.csv` file as the main data source."
